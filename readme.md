#SprintScraper

##Webscraper for learning
The aim is to collect data about courses online and recommend the single best course for any person.

###Development
This tool was developed in less than 20 hours during a work sprint. I had no
prior knowledge of scraping and so the resulting code is somewhat chaotic.
Nonetheless, it does get data from Udemy and Edx, despite both sides loading
content dynamically with asynchronous calls. May be developed further into
a working MVP - collecting data is just a beginning.
